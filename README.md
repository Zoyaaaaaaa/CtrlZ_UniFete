# CtrlZ_UniFete
A comprehensive platform facilitating event coordination within educational institutions, UniFete integrates approval processes from key authorities like the Principal, Dean of Student Affairs, H.O.D, and Faculty Mentor. It empowers committees to schedule events seamlessly, access venue availability, and engage students campus-wide, ensuring efficient event management and participation.

Enter nodemon server.js

As per the guidance from our mentors, we have incorporated a robust form within our project to systematically gather specific requirements from committees for their respective events. This form includes key parameters such as expected footfall and event type, allowing committees to provide detailed information. Additionally, we have implemented an approval system. Committees submit their event requests through this system, facilitating a thorough evaluation by faculty/HOD to either approve or decline requests. This mentor-suggested approach ensures a structured and effective process for managing a diverse range of events within our project framework
